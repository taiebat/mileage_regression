# Coursera Regression Models Course Project

## Author: Morteza Taiebat

### Context
You work for _Motor Trend,_Â a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:
* Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG
* Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions

### Question
Take the `mtcars` data set and write up an analysis to answer their question using regression models and exploratory data analyses.

Your report must be:
*   Written as a PDF printout of a compiled (using knitr) R markdown document.
*   Brief. Roughly the equivalent of 2 pages or less for the main text. Supporting figures in an appendix can be included up to 5 total pages including the 2 for the main report. The appendix can only include figures.
*   Include a first paragraph executive summary.
